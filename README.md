[![attest](https://github.com/crossecute/forge-attest/actions/workflows/attest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crossecute/forge-attest/actions/workflows/attest.yml)

**Prove that a Gnosis Safe transaction is exactly the output of a specific Forge
script, and was not changed on its way to the Safe.**

An ops or treasury team builds a Safe transaction with a Forge script in one repo,
then submits the resulting JSON to a Safe for signers to approve. That leaves a
question no signer can answer: *is the thing in the Safe queue really what the
script produced, or was it edited in between?* `forge-attest` answers it by
re-deriving everything from a pinned commit and comparing hashes. It uses
[`safe-tx-hashes-util`](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/safe-tx-hashes-util) for the
live comparison.

```
 ATTESTED  the submitted Safe tx is exactly the output of script/BuildSafeTx.s.sol:BuildSafeTx@df1d6f369294
```

## How it proves it

A claim in [`attest.toml`](attest.toml) names a producer repo, a pinned commit, the
script it runs, and the exact outputs that commit must produce. Given one,
`./attest.sh` runs five independent checks, each layered on the last:

| # | Check | Answers | How |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Source integrity** | Is this the genuine, unmodified output of *that* script version? | Clone the producer at the pinned commit, re-run its Forge script, and assert the emitted JSON's `sha256` equals the pinned value. |
| 2 | **Canonical integrity** | Does it describe the same transaction, whatever the producer's formatting? | Fold the JSON into one canonical `SafeTx` and assert *its* `sha256` matches. Stable across timestamps, key order and hex casing. Use this pin when a producer does not emit the same bytes every run. |
| 3 | **Hash derivation (cast)** | Does that map to exactly one Safe tx? | Recompute the EIP-712 `safeTxHash` from the canonical form with `cast`; assert it equals the pinned `expected_safe_tx_hash`. |
| 4 | **Hash cross-check (Solidity)** | Is the derivation itself trustworthy? | A `forge test` re-reads the *producer's* JSON, redoes the folding and recomputes the same hash in Solidity, asserting it agrees with #3 and the pinned value. No single implementation is trusted, and normalisation itself is covered. |
| 5 | **Live integrity** | Is the tx *actually queued in the Safe* the same one? | Run `safe-tx-hashes-util` against the Safe Transaction Service (`--network --address --nonce`) and assert the queued tx's hash equals the script-derived hash. |

If all active checks pass, the submitted Safe tx is provably the script's output. If
anything was changed (the script, the JSON, or the queued tx) at least one hash
diverges. The run then prints **`NOT ATTESTED`** and exits non-zero.

## Usage

```bash
./attest.sh                       # uses ./attest.toml
./attest.sh --config my.toml      # a different claim
./attest.sh --require-live        # fail (don't skip) if the live check can't run
./attest.sh --json                # machine-readable verdict on stdout
./attest.sh --keep                # keep the temp clone for inspection
```

Requirements: `git`, `foundry` (`forge` + `cast`), `jq`, `sha256sum`, `bash`.

Exit code is the verdict: `0` attested, `1` not.

### Machine-readable output

`--json` writes the verdict to stdout and moves the human report to stderr, so a
caller gets both without scraping colours:

```bash
./attest.sh --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.hashes.safe_tx'
```

```json
{
  "attested": true,
  "producer": { "repo": "…", "commit": "df1d6f36…", "script": "script/BuildSafeTx.s.sol:BuildSafeTx" },
  "safe": { "address": "0x111CEE…", "nonce": "42", "network": "ethereum", "version": "1.3.0" },
  "toolchain": { "forge": "1.7.1-stable", "forge_commit": "…", "cast": "1.7.1-stable", "producer_solc": "0.8.28" },
  "hashes": {
    "output_sha256": "f8b05de9…",
    "canonical_sha256": "9057b9be…",
    "domain": "0xf10a0411…",
    "message": "0xe6548104…",
    "safe_tx": "0xd0e33f3b…",
    "safe_tx_solidity": "0xd0e33f3b…",
    "safe_tx_live": ""
  },
  "nested": null,
  "failures": []
}
```

A hash that was skipped rather than computed is `""`. An empty `safe_tx_live` means
the live check did not run, not that it passed. `nested` is `null` unless
the claim names a child Safe. `failures` lists exactly what a `NOT ATTESTED`
verdict is based on.

## GitHub Action

The action at the root of this repository runs the same script:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
- uses: crossecute/forge-attest@1de27d7dd172c54dd00d1494a69cb203c05a8f07 # v1.0.0
  with:
    config: attest.toml
    require-live: true
```

It installs Foundry, runs `attest.sh --json` against your config, writes the
verdict to the job summary, and exposes `attested`, `safe-tx-hash`,
`canonical-sha256`, `child-safe-tx-hash`, and the full `json` document as step
outputs. Put `attest.toml` in your own ops repo and point `producer_repo` at it.

**Pin the action to a commit SHA, not a tag.** A tag can be moved, so whoever can
move it decides what "verified" means in your pipeline. That is the exact property
this tool exists to remove. Pinning a SHA fixes the action, `attest.sh`, `lib/`,
and the Solidity cross-check together, because they are all this one repository at
one commit. `foundry-version` matters for the same reason: `forge` re-runs the
producer's script, so a moving toolchain can move the output bytes. That is why it
defaults to a pinned release rather than `stable`. Override it deliberately, and
bump it as a reviewed change.

That argument binds us too, so the action pins its own dependencies by commit SHA
rather than by tag. Otherwise whoever could move a tag we referenced would get code
execution inside the verification step of every pipeline using this action. That is
the one step whose output everyone downstream is trusting.

A pin nobody moves has its own problem. It freezes the repo on whatever was current
the day it was written, and misses exactly the security fixes that made pinning
worth doing. [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) proposes the bumps,
review decides, and the pin stays a SHA.

## Supported producer formats

`forge-attest` takes whatever Safe JSON your ops repo already emits. It detects the
format automatically, or you name it with `input_format`.

### `safe-tx`: a complete transaction

A flat object carrying the full EIP-712 `SafeTx` field set. All scalars are quoted
strings so large integers survive JSON:

```json
{
  "safe": "0x…", "chainId": "1", "safeVersion": "1.3.0",
  "to": "0x…", "value": "0", "data": "0x…", "operation": "0",
  "safeTxGas": "0", "baseGas": "0", "gasPrice": "0",
  "gasToken": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "refundReceiver": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "nonce": "42"
}
```

### `tx-builder`: a Safe{Wallet} Transaction Builder batch

The shape produced by the Safe UI's "export batch" and by FraxFinance's
[`SafeTxHelper.writeTxs`](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-standard-solidity/blob/master/src/SafeTxHelper.sol):

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "chainId": 10,
  "createdAt": 1760128999000,
  "meta": { "name": "Transactions Batch", "description": "" },
  "transactions": [
    { "to": "0x…", "value": "0", "data": "0x…", "operation": "0" }
  ]
}
```

### `tx-array`: a bare array

Just the `transactions` list, with no envelope. `chain_id` then has to come from the
config.

### What a batch does *not* tell you

A batch carries no Safe address, no nonce and no gas fields. **It is not yet a
transaction.** It becomes one only when bound to a specific Safe at a specific nonce
and folded into the single call owners actually sign:

- **more than one transaction** → packed into `multiSend(bytes)` and executed as a
  `DELEGATECALL` into `MultiSendCallOnly`, exactly as Safe{Wallet} submits it.
- **exactly one transaction** → sent directly to its target, also matching the UI.
  Override with `batch_mode = "multisend"`.

So `safe_address` and `safe_nonce` in `attest.toml` are *inputs to the hash* for
batch formats, not just live-check settings. The same batch on a different Safe, or
at a different nonce, is a different transaction and will not match a pin.

The schema does have a slot for the Safe, `meta.createdFromSafeAddress`, and
`forge-attest` reads it. A producer that fills it in makes the file self-binding, so
`safe_address` becomes an independent cross-check rather than a required input. If
the two disagree, that is a tampering signal, and the run fails rather than picking
one. Nothing carries the nonce, so that always comes from the config.

The default `MultiSendCallOnly` is the canonical deployment for the configured
`safe_version`. Versions 1.3.x, 1.4.x and 1.5.x are known. Any other version must
name `multisend_address`.

That default is **not** universal across chains. On some chains the canonical
address is not deployed at all. On the zkSync-family chains (zkSync Era, Abstract,
and others) a deployment with different bytecode is the one Safe{Wallet} actually
uses. Rather than guess, `forge-attest` refuses on those chains and asks for
`multisend_address`:

```
normalize.sh: chain 324 does not use the canonical MultiSendCallOnly for Safe 1.3.0;
              pass --multisend explicitly (see lib/multisend-exceptions.json)
```

[`lib/multisend-exceptions.json`](lib/multisend-exceptions.json) is generated from
[`safe-global/safe-deployments`](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) and
read by *both* derivations, so the two cannot drift. Safe 1.5.0 has no divergent
chains; 1.4.1 has 7; 1.3.0 has 112.

Batches are also where the byte-exact `sha256` stops being usable. `SafeTxHelper`
stamps `createdAt` with `block.timestamp * 1000`, so the file's bytes change on every
run. Leave `expected_output_sha256` blank for such producers and pin
`expected_canonical_sha256` instead. The canonical form has a fixed key order,
quoted scalars and lowercase hex. Timestamps, `meta`, key reordering, address
checksum casing, and string-versus-number scalars therefore cannot move it, while
anything the Safe would actually execute does.

You can run the normaliser on its own to see what a given file folds into:

```bash
./lib/normalize.sh --input path/to/batch.json \
  --safe 0x<safe> --nonce <n> --summary
```

### Refused on purpose

- **`contractMethod` with a null `data`.** UI exports can describe a call as an ABI
  method plus input values. Encoding that requires the target ABI; rather than invent
  calldata, `forge-attest` fails and asks for an export with encoded `data`.
- **Inner `operation: 1` under `MultiSendCallOnly`.** That contract reverts on
  delegatecalls, so the batch could never execute. Pass the plain MultiSend via
  `multisend_address` if you really mean it.
- **A config value that contradicts the JSON.** If both carry a `chainId` and they
  disagree, that is a tampering signal. It errors rather than silently picking one.

## Nested Safes

When a Safe is owned by other Safes, a child cannot sign. It approves on-chain by
calling `parent.approveHash(h)`, where `h` is the parent's transaction hash. That
approval is a Safe transaction in its own right, and it is the one the child's owners
actually sign. They never sign the parent transaction.

They also cannot see it. `approveHash` stores a flag against `(owner, hash)` and never
learns the preimage. At execution the full transaction is supplied again and re-hashed.
So no on-chain state can tell a signer what `0xd4d9bdcd6dadc73a…` means. The preimage
exists only in the producer's artifact. That is what this closes.

Add to any claim:

```toml
child_safe    = "0x<the child Safe>"
child_nonce   = "7"
child_network = ""     # set to also check what is queued on the child itself
expected_child_safe_tx_hash = ""
```

There is no artifact for the approval and no producer script writes one. Given the
parent Safe, the parent hash, the child Safe and the child's nonce, every field is
determined, so `forge-attest` constructs it. It does so in bash and in Solidity
independently, and compares the two as it does every other hash:

```
==> Nested approval (child Safe)
    child    : 0x2222AA…22FF nonce 7
    approves : 0x7f9d67d2…c115
    signs    : 0x6ca5575d…b660
  ✓ Solidity agrees with cast on the approval

 ATTESTED  …
     sign 0x6ca5575d…b660 on 0x2222AA…22FF
    valid only while 0x111CEEee…2177 nonce == 43
```

That last line is the part to read carefully. The parent hash binds the parent's
nonce. If the parent executes anything else first, every stored approval silently
stops matching, and execution fails as `GS025`, "invalid owner", with nothing in the
error pointing at the real cause.

**Out of scope:**

- Whether enough children approved. `approveHash` reverts with `GS030` unless the
  caller is already an owner, so a mis-aimed approval cannot silently count, but the
  tool does not tally approvals against the threshold.
- Nesting more than one level deep.
- EIP-1271 contract signatures, which produce a signature blob rather than a
  reviewable transaction.
- Several different transactions queued at the same nonce.

## Pointing it at your own repo

Edit `attest.toml`:

```toml
producer_repo   = "https://github.com/you/your-ops-repo"
producer_commit = "<40-hex commit sha>"
producer_script = "script/YourScript.s.sol:YourScript"
output_path     = "out/safe-tx.json"

expected_output_sha256    = "<sha256 of that JSON>"     # blank if not byte-stable
expected_canonical_sha256 = "<sha256 of the canonical form>"
expected_safe_tx_hash     = "0x<safeTxHash>"

safe_network = "ethereum"
safe_address = "0x<your safe>"
safe_nonce   = "<nonce>"
```

To get the pinned values the first time, run once with them blank. The orchestrator
prints every hash it computes. Paste those back in as the expectation *after
reviewing the transaction*. See
[`attest.batch.example.toml`](attest.batch.example.toml) for a fully commented batch
claim.

## Threat model

**Catches**
- The Forge script was changed (any commit other than the pinned one → different
  output → sha256 + hash mismatch).
- The JSON was hand-edited after the script ran (`to`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`, …)
  → derived hash diverges.
- A batch was edited: a transaction added, removed, reordered, redirected, or its
  calldata altered → the `multiSend` payload and therefore the signed hash change.
- The batch was re-bound to a different Safe, nonce or chain → different hash.
- The tx queued in the Safe differs from the script output → live hash mismatch
  (check #5).
- A nested approval pointing at a different transaction than the one under review.
  The approval is re-derived from the parent, never read back from it.

**Trusts, and why that is safe**
- The Safe Transaction Service (check #5) is queried over the network, but a
  compromised or impersonated service can only cause a false *negative*. The
  comparison is against a hash this tool derived offline from the script's own
  output. Producing a false *positive* means returning exactly that hash, which
  requires already knowing the honest answer and gains an attacker nothing. Treat
  an unreachable service as an unknown, not as a pass. That is what
  `--require-live` is for.
- The four offline checks need no network at all beyond cloning the pinned
  producer commit, whose SHA is verified after checkout.

**Does not catch (out of scope)**
- Whether the script's *intent* is correct. `forge-attest` proves provenance, not
  that the transaction does what you want. Review the script.
- A malicious producer commit that you then pin. You are attesting to a specific
  commit, so pin one you have reviewed.
- Safe contract versions `< 1.3.0` in the offline deriver (checks #3/#4). The live
  check (#5) still handles them via `safe-tx-hashes-util`.
- Batch entries expressed as `contractMethod` plus inputs with no encoded calldata.
  These are refused rather than guessed at.
- Whether a nested approval will still be valid when it executes. The parent's nonce
  can move at any time, and only the live check can notice.
- A SHA-1 collision on `producer_commit`. The checkout is verified against the
  pinned SHA, but git commit ids are SHA-1, for which chosen-prefix collisions
  have been demonstrated. Git's collision detection and GitHub's rejection of
  known-colliding objects make this impractical rather than impossible; it is
  accepted, not mitigated here.

### Running this is running the config's code

`producer_setup` is executed with `bash -c`, and `forge script` runs the producer's
Solidity. Both are the point, because the tool cannot reproduce a build without
running it. It does mean **whoever can edit `attest.toml` can execute code on the
runner.**

In your own CI that is usually fine: the config is in your repo, behind review. Two
cases deserve care.

- **Fork pull requests.** With the standard `pull_request` trigger, a fork PR that
  edits `attest.toml` gets code execution in your CI. GitHub runs it with a
  read-only token and no access to secrets, so this is the ordinary "CI builds
  untrusted code" situation. It is acceptable, but worth knowing.
- **Never use `pull_request_target`.** It runs with the base repo's secrets and a
  writable token, against the *fork's* files. Combined with `producer_setup` that
  hands an attacker your secrets. If you need attestation on fork PRs, keep
  `pull_request` and accept that the run is untrusted.

The same applies to `producer_repo`: it is cloned and its build is run. Point it at
a repo you control.

## Tests

The verifier has its own test suite. Nothing it attests is worth much if its two
hash derivations do not agree.

```bash
forge test            # Solidity: hashing, MultiSend packing, every JSON format
./test/shell/run.sh   # bash: normalisation, cast-vs-Solidity, full end-to-end runs
```

`test/fixtures/` holds one file per supported shape, including a real
`SafeTxHelper`-generated batch from FraxFinance's `frax-oft-upgradeable`. See
[`test/fixtures/README.md`](test/fixtures/README.md). Both suites derive hashes from
the same fixtures independently and assert the same pinned values, so a divergence
between the bash and Solidity implementations fails the build.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/attest.yml`](.github/workflows/attest.yml) runs the tests and then
the full attestation pipeline on every push/PR and nightly. A green CI run is a
public, timestamped attestation that a third party can rely on without re-running
anything. (In CI, set `producer_repo` to a reachable git URL rather than a `file://`
path.) It runs through `uses: ./`, so the action published from this repo is
exercised on every push rather than only in consumers' pipelines.

## Trust anchor

`forge-attest` never asks you to trust *it*. Every hash is derived three ways from
inputs you pin: with `cast`, in Solidity, and live with `safe-tx-hashes-util`. The
two offline implementations fold batches independently rather than sharing code. Do
not trust, verify.
