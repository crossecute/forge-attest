# nested.sh: build the Safe transaction a *child* Safe sends to approve a
#            transaction on a parent Safe it owns.
#
# A Safe cannot produce an ECDSA signature, so when a Safe owns another Safe it
# approves on-chain instead: it calls `parent.approveHash(h)`, where `h` is the
# parent's EIP-712 transaction hash. That approval is itself a Safe transaction,
# and it is the one the child's owners actually sign.
#
# Nothing about it is a matter of choice. Given the parent Safe, the parent's
# hash, the child Safe and the child's nonce, every field is determined:
#
#     to        = <parent safe>
#     value     = 0
#     data      = 0xd4d9bdcd ‖ <parent hash>      (36 bytes)
#     operation = 0
#     gas fields = 0
#     nonce     = <child nonce>
#
# So this script *constructs* the transaction rather than verifying a file. There
# is no producer artifact for an approval, and inventing one would only add
# something else to tamper with. The output is a canonical SafeTx, so
# `derive.sh` hashes it exactly like any other.
#
# Note what the parent hash does NOT tell the Safe: nothing. `approveHash` stores
# a flag against (owner, hash) and never learns the preimage. At execution the
# full transaction is supplied again and re-hashed. That is why the parent's
# decoded intent has to travel with this. On-chain state can never explain to a
# signer what they approved.
#
# Usage:
#   nested.sh --parent-safe 0x… --parent-hash 0x… \
#             --child-safe 0x… --child-nonce N --chain-id N [--safe-version V]
